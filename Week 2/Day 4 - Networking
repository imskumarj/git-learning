# 🌐 Week 2 – Day 4: AWS Networking Fundamentals

> _“Networking is the nervous system of the cloud.”_

## 🧩 Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

### 🔹 What is a VPC?
An **Amazon VPC** lets you provision a **logically isolated section** of the AWS Cloud where you can launch resources in a **virtual network you control**.

Think of a VPC like your **own private office building inside AWS** 🏢.

---

### 🔹 Public vs Private Resources

Inside a VPC, resources can be:

- 🌍 **Public** → Has internet access  
- 🔒 **Private** → No direct internet access  

📌 Example (Coffee Shop Analogy ☕):

- **Customer** → Internet user  
- **Cashier** → Public resource (accessible from outside)  
- **Barista** → Private resource (internal-only)

```

Customer ───► Cashier (Public VPC)
│
▼
Barista (Private VPC)

```

## 🧱 Subnets

### 🔹 What are Subnets?
Subnets are used to **organize resources inside a VPC**.

- A subnet belongs to **one Availability Zone**
- Can be **public or private**

---

### 🔹 Public Subnet
- Has a route to the **Internet Gateway**
- Used for:
  - EC2 web servers
  - Load balancers

### 🔹 Private Subnet
- No direct internet route
- Used for:
  - Databases
  - Internal services

---

### 🔹 VPC + Subnet Architecture

```

Region
└── VPC
├── AZ-A
│   ├── Public Subnet → EC2
│   └── Private Subnet → DB
└── AZ-B
├── Public Subnet → EC2
└── Private Subnet → DB

```

🌐 Internet → Internet Gateway → Public Subnet  
🔒 Private Subnet stays isolated

---

## 🔐 VPN (Virtual Private Network)

### 🔹 When do we use VPN?
Use VPN when **secure connectivity is required**.

### 🔹 Benefits of VPN
- 🔐 Secure
- 🔁 Flexible
- 🌍 Remote access
- 📉 Cheaper than dedicated lines (in some cases)

---

## 🔗 AWS Direct Connect

### 🔹 What is Direct Connect?
A **dedicated private connection** between your data center and AWS.

📌 Used when:
- High bandwidth is required
- Low latency is critical
- Large data transfers are frequent

### 🔹 Advantages
- 🚀 High performance
- ⏱️ Low latency
- 🔐 Secure & reliable
- 📊 Consistent network performance

---

### 🔹 Ways to Connect to AWS Cloud

1. AWS Client VPN  
2. AWS Site-to-Site VPN  
3. AWS Direct Connect  
4. AWS Peering / Private Connectivity  

---

## 🌍 Global Networking & Content Delivery

### 🔹 Amazon Route 53 (DNS)

Route 53 is AWS’s **DNS service** 🌐.

#### Routing Policies:
- ⚡ Latency-based routing
- 🌍 Geolocation routing
- 🔁 Weighted routing
- 🔄 Simple round-robin

---

### 🔹 Amazon CloudFront (CDN)

CloudFront is AWS’s **Content Delivery Network**.

- Delivers content from **edge locations**
- Reduces latency
- Improves performance globally

```

User → Route 53 → CloudFront (Edge)

AWS Region

```

---

## 🧠 Global Architectures Overview

### 🔹 Edge Locations
- Cache frequently accessed content
- Serve users from the nearest location

### 🔹 Global Accelerator
- Improves availability & performance
- Routes traffic to optimal endpoints

---

## 🧱 Network Security

### 🔹 Network ACL (NACL)
- Works at **subnet level**
- Stateless
- Controls inbound & outbound traffic

### 🔹 Security Groups
- Works at **instance level**
- Stateful
- Acts like a firewall for EC2

📌 **Rule of Thumb**:
> NACL = Subnet gatekeeper  
> Security Group = Instance bodyguard 🛡️

---

## 🗺️ High-Level Networking Flow

```

Public Subnet (EC2)
↓
Private Subnet (DB)

## 🧪 Key Takeaways (Quick Revision)

- VPC = isolated network in AWS  
- Subnets divide VPC by AZ & access type  
- Public ≠ Secure, Private ≠ Inaccessible  
- VPN = secure tunnel  
- Direct Connect = dedicated highway  
- Route 53 = traffic director  
- CloudFront = global delivery booster  

---

## ✅ Exam / Interview Ready Lines

- “A VPC provides logical isolation in AWS.”
- “Subnets are AZ-specific.”
- “Security Groups are stateful, NACLs are stateless.”
- “CloudFront reduces latency using edge caching.”
- “Direct Connect ensures predictable performance.”
